"Traditional stock analysis looks at one ticker at a time.
SOOIQ analyzes entire market SECTORS using real-time news.

When breaking news hits, our AI:
1. Classifies which sector is affected
2. Analyzes sentiment using FinBERT
3. Generates predictions for TOP stocks in that sector

This gives investors a MACRO view of market movements
before making micro decisions on individual stocks.

For the demo, we're tracking 3 major sectors covering
80% of market capitalization. The system is designed
to scale to all 11 GICS sectors."
